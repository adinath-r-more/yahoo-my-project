    <p>Sports accessibility, encompassing physical modifications, adaptive equipment, and inclusive policies, allows individuals with disabilities to participate in sports, fostering physical and mental health, building confidence, and promoting social inclusion. This accessibility is not just a benefit but a fundamental right, as affirmed by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which emphasizes the equal participation of persons with disabilities in sports. Challenges like insufficient funding, a lack of awareness, and discriminatory attitudes hinder true accessibility. Addressing these barriers requires a concerted effort.</p>
